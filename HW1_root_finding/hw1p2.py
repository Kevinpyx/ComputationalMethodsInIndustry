        The newton's method doesn't work when x_0=-3 but works when x_0=-2. The problem with -3 is 
        the gradient at -3 is too flat so it leads us to a point with greater x (absolute) value, 
        where the gradient is even flatter. And then we get to a point even farther away from the root
